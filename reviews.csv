Great phone, for it's price and also otherwise",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never in my life I waited for a phone this bad and happy to say the wait was worth it. My LG started giving me issues just after a few months and the Samsung before that had 3 display issues in about 15 months. Tired of splurging on flagship Androids, I started looking for alternatives - the cheaper kinds, the more value for money kindsOnePlus has a pretty loyal band of followers but I never appreciated the Chinese-ness of it but boy, the device is as premium as it can get. OnePlus 6 as I understood from my friends was a great device and OnePlus 6T ought to be better, right? Well, it is, objectively.Call quality: Isn't that the primary purpose of any phone. Much better than the LG which was as good as unusable and slightly topping the SamsungsSpeaker: Reasonably loud to be useful but don't expect it to win sound quality awards. My LG with DAC stands defeated when I use it with my earphones and headphones. My Beyerdynamic cans are useless though as somehow connecting it results in ghost clicksDisplay: Amazing, if you know what AMOLED is you'd know the bright contrast-y nature of the display with equally amazing blacks.. and better power management. For the first time ever, started watching movies on mobilesProcessor, RAM and graphics: Snappy and does make you feel you are holding a fast, latest, flagship device. Should hold good for probably 2 yearsBuild quality: Very unchinesy (for want of a better word). Edges feel strong yet beautifully carved, sides are solid and buttons are tactile yet feel built to last. The package comes with a case and I am using a case. Another personal first! Oh, the package was thoughtful like none other. Almost feels like a personalized gift boxBattery: Pretty darn good. I was 98% at 2200 hours, used for 3-4 hours non-stop in the night and it still took me thru to 1700 hours the other day with medium to heavy usage. I just recently let battery go under 5% and feel it's discharging faster now (could only be psychological). Don't let battery go too low though in most likelihood it doesn't do anything as the phone shuts down before it reaches true 0Camera: I bet this is what people are interested in most - the reason why it's last here! The hardware is not much different from the OP6 but in a blind camera test, the T took slightly better low light images with the 6 blowing off highlights more. It could be an issue with that one device but suffice to say the camera is awesome and very capable unless you go comparing with the Pixel 3. I was literally blown from the result of clicking a really, really dark scene and it still had magically squeezed in almost natural light in the picture - just don't expect to create a 10x10 photo frame and you'll be fine. In regular night scenes with some ambient light, there isn't much difference between Auto and night mode. Photography under normal light condition is good - adequately sharp, not overtly saturated and we'll detailed. I find the white balance slightly off but can be fixed in ""pro"" settings. At times, the highlight gets blown out but that's okay for a phone at this price point and I believe many of the camera shortcomings can be fixed with a software upgrade. I would have preferred a wide-angle camera over the depth camera - mind you, the depth camera too works brilliantly in portrait mode and gives you a more natural bokeh effect than software enhanced background blurAll in all, I am quite satisfied with the purchase and probably gonna stick with OnePlus having experimented with most Android manufacturers. Highly recommended!"

4 years l Genuine brand with humbleness",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in August 2019 and still using this. Though running out of memory due to media storage, the phone is excellent. What I really liked about this brand is that in Feb 2024, colour lines started to appear. When I took it to service center they said it will screen replacement free of charges. Many other customers were waiting there too and they did the same for all. Now, this happening in a Samsung or Apple is like 8th Wonder. So trust one plus brand. I also have Samsung S22 Ultra mobile. Samsung charges for even 13th month screen issue due to software update. Decide for yourself."

Amazing performance without breaking the bank!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall: 8/10:A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)Unboxing & contents: 8/10One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.First Impressions: 9/10The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.Setup: 8/10The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.Battery: 7/10The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.Performance: 9/10Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.Hope this helps!"

Sturdy and a workhorse.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"My phone completes 5 years today. In these years, it has been with me through thick and thin and has given me lesser problems than humans. It's not the most flashy, feature loaded phone but when the chips are down, it gets the work done. Never have I ever had an issue with its battery life. All in all, if I could back in time, I would still purchase this one."

5,Aayush Patil,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Worth Every Rupee!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.Now onto the phone...Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.Conclusion:+Screen+Battery+Internals+Software+Camera+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer-no 3.5mm jack-no wireless charging (not important for me)BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. GO FOR IT!!!!"

Compromise on the headphone jack and you get so much more.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:Superb battery life...streches to 7hrs of screen on time..on heavy usage 5.5 to 6 hrs screen on time.Camera quality...well lets just say its good but for the price range,its mediocore...but most of us wont even notice the difference. Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.Built quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.I went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.Sound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :Dcoming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).It takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.Ummm what else....Yeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.But the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..Its open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...But belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.Oxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!Cons:The nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.Headphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger  to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.The weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!It is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!Also since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!If you have any questions,do ask!"

great phone as expected",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi Everyone writing this review after using the one plus 6T for a week i would also like to mention i got this at a great price considering 8GB and 128GB the power it packs so pretty satisfied with price point i will divide this review into pros & cons for your understanding starting with the Box one plus packaging is great and as soon as you open the box you will you have joined the elite community  i also received some one plus never settle sticker which was a surprisePros- OPTIC AMOLED display looks great  In display finger print scanner gives a futuristic look.  Oxygen OS great customisation level and feeling of stock android at the same time.  Camera in potrait mode especially selfie camera is great with some good detailing , i know camera has not been the strongest point of one plus but with 6T its improved especially in artificial lighting conditions as per my observations.  phone feels premium once held and gives you the proudness of being a part of one plus community.  i think i have read the review and i felt no body talked about the quality of the charger one plus provides i mean i have seen the higher end flagship phone and man the charger quality is so great cables are tangle free and quite thick  - dash charge - i was using the previous phone lenovo P2 with a fast charger and it had 5000 mah battery which use to take around 1hr:45 min to charge from 30% - 100% but dash charging is like man so fast it takes hardly 30 min to charge from 40% - 95% that really fast so its like you are at peace you know that whatever time you have if you charge it you are good for a day  Cons-  no 3.5 mm jack and i found the USB tye c to 3.5 mm connector does not give a great output i have tried with Audio technica headphones i hope i can fix that with some update or some equalizer though i use bluetooth earphone when im travelling and with that the sound was as expected.  Dual speakers could have been a great add-on but i dont mind it much as i dont primarily use loudspeaker other than calls  Also i miss the notification led which could have been a great value some common issues i faced after buying and how i soughted it out can help others  1. battery drain- as soon as i bought the phone and used it i started to experience the battery drain and o boy it was draining like hell but then i read some blogs and found a fix to it by deleting the cache i did that and now the battery performance is great im not a heavy user but it easily last a day with 40 % till next dayThanks AMazon & one plus for providing great experience keep it up !!"

(Pictures and videos attached)(Star Rating out of 5)Phone Overall Rating:  ★ ★ ★ ★Camera Quality Rating ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Battery Backup  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed/Performance:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Operating System:  ★ ★ ★ ★Fingerprint Scanner:  ★ ★ ★ ★Usability/Gestures,etc:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Sound Quality:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★The in-box contents:• The 3.5mm audio jack to USB-C adaptor cable is really useful for the mass. OnePlus has taken care that removing the audio jack doesn't *force* one to buy new headphones.• The *phone cover* is sufficient and one wouldn't need to buy a new cover unless one likes to have personalized phone covers.ReviewI reluctantly exchanged my note 4 for this but after weeks use, I feel this is awesome despite few glitchesMy Experience as a power user of phones:I bought this phone by using the exchange offer with the MI Note 4 that I had used for over two years. Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:• The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.• The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.• Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.• In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.• Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.• Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.• Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.• Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.• Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.• Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41” which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6’s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28” but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!• Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.• 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.• If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.• 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that’s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.•  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.• The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).• But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for."

Very good",4.0 out of 5 stars,"VerdictThe OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.ProsNew fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edgeUp-to-date, versatile OSFast Charge is still greatSleek, premium designGreat performanceGreat battery lifeConsCamera's Nightscape mode needs workAnother headphone jack bites the dustFingerprint sensor needs refinementPoor audio capabilitieshis affordable Android flagship sports a lightning-fast in-display fingerprint sensor and powerful performance for half the price of its rivals.Super-fast in-display fingerprint sensorGorgeous display with tiny teardrop notchImproved camera supportAndroid Pie out of the box.AGAINSTNo headphone jackLacks wireless chargingCamera: Improved, but not amazingOnePlus didn't make any tweaks to the camera hardware in the 6T. Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.Performance: Flagship speed for lessThe 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XRThe OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to KnowThe 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notchOnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.Display: Still stunningThe OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.AGAINST'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot"
